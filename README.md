## **This is my updated portfolio**
Welcome to my first Portfolio.
## This project was built with Bootstrap resources, including rows, columns, navbar, forms and style fonts and background. It's also accomplished by individual style on CSS, and icons taken from FontAwesome, a nice resource as Bootstrap and Google Fonts.

* The index.html page looks like this:

### You can access here: [Portfolio](https://herivillaz.github.io/Portfolio_updated/)

* As we can see it's provided by a Responsive Navbar 

![Navigation Bar](./public/assetsREADME/1589578680883.png)

* This Navigation Bar contains responsive links that take you to other sections:
* **About me**
* **Portfolio**
* **Contact**

* About Me contains the small Biography of Me (Heribert Villazana) plus responsive links to My social Networking, these links you will find also on Portfolio and Contact.

* On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. Also in `sm` screens and larger screens there are implemented margins. Taking in consideration that also the Navigation bar adjusts to the screen.
